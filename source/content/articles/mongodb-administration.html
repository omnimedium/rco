<h2>Setup</h2>

<h2>Administration interfaces</h2>

<h2>Backups</h2>

<p>Backing up and restoring data is done easily with the <strong>mongodump</strong> and <strong>mongorestore</strong> tool. These tools should not be confused with <strong>mongoexport</strong> and <strong>mongoimport</strong>, which allow you to load a import and export data in JSON format. (Not ideal for backups, due to loss of information - JSON has fewer types)</p>

<p>The <strong>mongodump</strong> command could look like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">
mongodump \
--host 188.166.100.89 \
--port 27017 \
-u administrator \
-p pass \
--gzip \
--archive=backup.$(date +%Y_%m_%d_%H%M%S).gz
</code></pre>

<p>You could set this up as a daily job in Jenkins for a very simple backup system.</p>
