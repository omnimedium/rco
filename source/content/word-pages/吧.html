<p><span data-word data-meaning="(tone softening particle)" data-pinyin="ba">吧</span> is a very common sentence final particle in Chinese. We mainly use it to soften our speech in a command, suggestion, supposition or statement, or to concede an agreement or an acceptance to something.</p>

<p>As you can imagine or you might have noticed already, we use this particle a lot. Now we will go through the situations where <span data-word data-meaning="(tone softening particle)" data-pinyin="ba">吧</span> is often used.</p>

<h2>To soften tones in a command</h2>

<p><span data-word data-meaning="(tone softening particle)" data-pinyin="ba">吧</span> is very useful when we want to make a command but don't want to sound so strong. As the tone becomes less gentle, a command with <span data-word data-meaning="(tone softening particle)" data-pinyin="ba">吧</span> also sounds like a suggestion.</p>

<p>Here's a Chinese sentence written inline. It can be written inside of a paragraph, or anywhere else. 
    <span data-sentence class="chinese-sentence"><span class="inner">
        <span data-word data-meaning="weather" data-pinyin="tiānqì">天氣</span>
        <span data-word data-meaning="very" data-pinyin="hěn" >很</span>
        <span data-word data-meaning="hot" data-pinyin="rè" >熱</span>
        <span data-word data-meaning="" data-pinyin="," >，</span>
        <span data-word data-meaning="more" data-pinyin="duō" >多</span>
        <span data-word data-meaning="to drink" data-pinyin="hē" >喝</span>
        <span data-word data-meaning="a little" data-pinyin="diǎn" >點</span>
